# Progress

**What Works:**
- Initial project analysis complete: Python Discord bot functionality, dependencies, and deployment details understood.
- Memory bank files updated with initial analysis.
- Railway selected as the preferred free, persistent hosting platform for the Node.js bot.
- Core Discord bot setup (Node.js) implemented: `package.json`, `index.js` with client setup, intents, and guild join/leave events.
- Gemini API integration for `/ask` command implemented.
- Hugging Face API integration for `/generate_image` command implemented.
- All three slash commands (`/ask`, `/generate_image`, `/help`) defined and their interaction handling logic implemented.
- Environment variable loading configured.
- `.gitignore` file updated.
- Python-related remnant files (`main.py`, `requirements.txt`, `Procfile`, `runtime.txt`) removed for a clean Node.js project.
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback for Gemini and Hugging Face API integrations implemented.
- Code modularized for better organization: API interactions moved to `api/` directory and command logic moved to `commands/` directory.
- Discord bot activity status made configurable via environment variables.
- Bot logs now sent to a private Discord channel via webhook, configurable with `DISCORD_LOG_CHANNEL_ID` and `DISCORD_LOG_TOKEN` environment variables.
- Error handling for `/ask` and `/generate_image` commands improved in their respective command files to prevent application timeouts.
- Command-specific errors are now logged to the configured Discord log channel.
- Logger improved to capture full error objects and stack traces for better diagnostics.
- Gemini API integration improved with robust URL validation and a default API URL.
- Hugging Face API integration improved with a dedicated base URL constant and specific error handling for model loading (503 status).
- Deprecated `ephemeral: true` usage replaced with `flags: MessageFlags.Ephemeral` for interaction responses.
- API functions (`api/gemini.js` and `api/huggingface.js`) now throw errors instead of returning error strings, ensuring full error objects are logged for better diagnostics.
- Identified 403 Forbidden error for Gemini API, likely due to incorrect/invalid API key or insufficient permissions.
- Updated Gemini API to use `gemini-2.0-flash` model.
- Identified 401 Unauthorized error for Hugging Face API, likely due to incorrect/invalid API key.
- Identified 404 Not Found error for Hugging Face API image generation, likely due to incorrect model ID or model not being found/accessible.
- Refactored Hugging Face API integration to use `@huggingface/inference` library with `stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0` model.
- Fixed issue where bot activity status was not showing by correctly applying `ActivityType` and conditionally including the `url` parameter.
- Added `/invite` command with a clickable invite button.
- `README.md` updated to reflect current project state, features, setup, and deployment.
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` and `SECURITY.md` updated with placeholder contact emails for easier maintainability.
- All bot output now uses `EmbedBuilder` for a more consistent and visually appealing presentation.
- Hugging Face image generation now uses `stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0` and `stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-refiner-1.0` for higher quality images.
- Refinement step for Hugging Face image generation temporarily removed due to 'No Inference Provider available' error; the base model is working.
- **Confirmed that `stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-refiner-1.0` is not deployed by any public Hugging Face Inference Provider, explaining the previous error.**

**What's Left to Build:**
- Deployment of the Node.js bot to Railway (instructions provided, awaiting user execution).
- End-to-end testing on Railway.
- User to verify `GEMINI_API_KEY` and associated API permissions.
- User to verify `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY`.
- User to verify Hugging Face model ID and accessibility.

**Current Status:**
The Node.js conversion is complete, improvements have been made, and the project is ready for deployment. We are now in the process of guiding the user through the deployment steps on Railway, and awaiting confirmation of deployment.

**Known Issues:**
- Netlify is not suitable for persistent Discord bot hosting.
- Potential issues related to API keys or Discord bot permissions during deployment.
