# Progress

**What Works:**
- Initial project analysis complete: Python Discord bot functionality, dependencies, and deployment details understood.
- Memory bank files updated with initial analysis.
- Railway selected as the preferred free, persistent hosting platform for the Node.js bot.
- Core Discord bot setup (Node.js) implemented: `package.json`, `index.js` with client setup, intents, and guild join/leave events.
- Gemini API integration for `/ask` command implemented.
- Hugging Face API integration for `/generate_image` command implemented.
- All three slash commands (`/ask`, `/generate_image`, `/help`) defined and their interaction handling logic implemented.
- Environment variable loading configured.
- `.gitignore` file updated.

**What's Left to Build:**
- Deployment of the Node.js bot to Railway (in progress).
- End-to-end testing on Railway.

**Current Status:**
The Node.js conversion is complete, and the project is ready for deployment. We are now in the process of guiding the user through the deployment steps on Railway.

**Known Issues:**
- Netlify is not suitable for persistent Discord bot hosting.
- The conversion from Python to Node.js is a significant undertaking (completed).
- Potential issues related to API keys or Discord bot permissions during deployment.
