# Active Context

**Current Work Focus:**
Currently, the focus is on guiding the user through the deployment process of the converted Node.js Discord bot to Railway, after assuming successful local testing.

**Recent Changes:**
-   The Node.js conversion is complete, including core bot functionalities, API integrations, and slash commands.
-   The `.gitignore` file has been updated for Node.js project best practices.
-   Local testing steps have been provided.

**Next Steps:**
1.  Provide step-by-step instructions for deploying the Node.js bot to Railway.
2.  Perform end-to-end testing on Railway to confirm successful deployment and functionality.

**Active Decisions and Considerations:**
-   The deployment target is Railway, and the focus is now entirely on getting the bot live on this platform.
-   Ensuring all environment variables are correctly configured on Railway is critical.
