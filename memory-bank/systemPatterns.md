# System Patterns

**Architecture:**
Based on the initial file scan, the system appears to follow a monolithic architecture, centered around the `main.py` script. There are no clear indications of microservices or distributed components.

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- Python as the primary language.
- Dependency management via `requirements.txt`.
- Deployment facilitated by `Procfile` (likely for Heroku or similar PaaS).

**Design Patterns:**
Specific design patterns are yet to be identified. Further code analysis of `main.py` is required to understand the internal structure and patterns used (e.g., event-driven, command pattern).

**Component Relationships:**
Currently, the primary component is `main.py`. Its relationships with external libraries are defined in `requirements.txt`. There's no clear indication of internal modularity or inter-component communication without deeper code inspection.
