# Tech Context

**Technologies Used:**
- **Primary Language:** Python (version specified in `runtime.txt`)
- **Dependencies:** Managed via `requirements.txt`. These typically include libraries for bot functionality, API interactions, etc.
- **Deployment:** Likely Heroku or a similar platform, inferred from `Procfile` (which usually defines how the application starts).

**Development Setup:**
- A standard Python development environment would be required.
- Installation of dependencies from `requirements.txt` using `pip`.

**Technical Constraints:**
- The project is bound by the capabilities and limitations of the Python version specified.
- External API rate limits or service constraints (if any) would apply.
- Resource limitations (memory, CPU) imposed by the deployment platform.

**Dependencies:**
- External Python libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.
- Any external services or APIs the bot interacts with (e.g., messaging platforms, databases).
