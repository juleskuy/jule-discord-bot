# Privacy Policy for jule

Last Updated: July 20, 2025

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how jule (the \"Service\") collects, uses, and discloses information about you.

## 1. Information We Collect

We collect information to provide and improve our Service. The types of information we may collect include:

- **Discord User IDs**: We may collect your Discord User ID to identify you within the Service, manage bot-specific settings, or respond to your commands. This ID is a unique identifier provided by Discord.
- **Command Usage Data**: We may log data related to the commands you use (e.g., `/ask` questions, `/generate_image` prompts) for debugging, performance monitoring, and service improvement. This data is typically anonymized or aggregated.
- **Server IDs**: We collect the ID of the Discord servers (guilds) your bot is in to manage server-specific settings and features.

We **do not** intentionally collect or store:
- Your personal Discord username or discriminator (e.g., `YourUsername#1234`).
- Any sensitive personal information.
- Private messages unless they are direct commands to the bot that require processing for a response.

## 2. How We Use Information

We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

- To operate and maintain the Service.
- To respond to your commands and provide the requested functionalities (e.g., AI answers, generated images).
- To monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities in connection with our Service to improve its performance and features.
- To detect, investigate, and prevent fraudulent transactions and other illegal activities and protect the rights and property of jule and others.

## 3. Information Sharing and Disclosure

We do not share, sell, or disclose your personal information with third parties, except in the following limited circumstances:

- **Service Providers**: We may share information with third-party vendors, consultants, and other service providers (e.g., Google Gemini API, Hugging Face API) who need access to such information to carry out work on our behalf. These service providers are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
- **Legal Compliance**: We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court order or government agency request).
- **Aggregated or Anonymized Data**: We may share aggregated or anonymized information that cannot reasonably be used to identify you.

## 4. Data Security

We implement reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no internet transmission or electronic storage is completely secure.

## 5. Third-Party Services

Our Service utilizes third-party APIs (Google Gemini, Hugging Face). Your use of these functionalities is also subject to their respective privacy policies and terms of service. We encourage you to review them:
- Google Privacy Policy: [https://policies.google.com/privacy]
- Hugging Face Privacy Policy: [https://huggingface.co/privacy]

## 6. Your Choices

- You can remove the bot from your server at any time.
- You can delete your Discord account, which will remove your User ID from our logs (though anonymized usage data may persist).

## 7. Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on our website or within the Service. Your continued use of the Service after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Privacy Policy.
